## Pre Build Setup

Before building the project add in the /api/index.js your mongodb connection to save the recorded sentences data.
In the /components/Stepper.vue file add the AMAZON-BUCKET details to upload the records.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
